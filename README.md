# Telecome_churn_case_study
This project aims to predict customer churn in a telecom company using machine learning models. Customer churn refers to customers discontinuing the use of a company's services, and predicting churn is crucial for retention strategies. By identifying high-risk customers, telecom companies can proactively offer tailored incentives to retain them.
